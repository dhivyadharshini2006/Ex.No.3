  ‚Ä¢	"In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."


### Conclusion 
### 1.	Straightforward Prompts:

Prompt 1: "Define photosynthesis in one sentence."
Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugar) for energy, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. üåø‚òÄÔ∏è
Prompt 2: "List three advantages of electric vehicles."
Here are three main advantages of electric vehicles (EVs):
Zero Tailpipe Emissions: EVs don't produce exhaust fumes, which improves local air quality and helps reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions.
Lower Running Costs: Charging an EV with electricity is typically cheaper than refueling a car with gasoline, and EVs require less maintenance because they have fewer moving parts.
Quieter and Smoother Ride: Electric motors provide instant torque for quick acceleration and operate almost silently, offering a more relaxing driving experience. üöó‚ö°

### 2.Tabular Format Prompting:
Prompt 1: "Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."

Here is a comparison between Alternating Current (AC) and Direct Current (DC).
| Feature | Alternating Current (AC) | Direct Current (DC) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Direction of Flow** | The current changes its direction periodically. | The current flows in only one direction. |
| **Frequency** | Has a frequency (usually 50 Hz or 60 Hz). | The frequency is zero. |
| **Source** | Power plants, generators, wall outlets. | Batteries, solar cells, phone chargers. |
| **Voltage Change** | Voltage can be easily increased or decreased with a transformer. | Changing the voltage is more complex and less efficient. |
| **Common Use** | Powering homes, large appliances, and electric motors. | Powering electronics like laptops, smartphones, and TVs. |

 Prompt 2: "Provide a table listing five programming languages, their paradigms, and one use case each."
Here is a table of five popular programming languages with their details.

| Programming Language | Primary Paradigm(s) | Common Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python** üêç | Object-Oriented, Procedural | Data Science & Machine Learning |
| **JavaScript** üåê | Event-Driven, Functional | Interactive Front-End Web Development |
| **Java** ‚òï | Object-Oriented | Enterprise-Scale Applications |
| **C++** üéÆ | Object-Oriented, Procedural | Video Game Development |
| **SQL** üóÉÔ∏è | Declarative | Managing and Querying Databases |

### 3. Preceding Question Prompting:

Climate Change and Greenhouse Gases
Climate change is a global concern because its effects are not limited by borders; they impact every country on Earth. These effects include rising sea levels, more frequent and intense extreme weather events like heatwaves and floods, disruptions to food supplies, and threats to ecosystems. Addressing this challenge requires worldwide cooperation, as the actions of one country can affect all others. üåç

This global warming is primarily driven by greenhouse gases. Here‚Äôs how they contribute:

Sunlight Warms the Earth: The sun sends energy to Earth, which warms the planet's surface.

Heat Radiates Back: The Earth's surface then sends some of this energy back toward space in the form of heat.

Gases Trap the Heat: Greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, like carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ), act like a blanket. They trap this outgoing heat and prevent it from escaping. This natural process is called the greenhouse effect, and it keeps our planet warm enough for life.

Too Much of a Good Thing: However, human activities like burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) have released a large amount of extra greenhouse gases. This extra "blanket" traps too much heat, causing the Earth's average temperature to rise, which we call global warming.

How Vaccines and Immunization Work
Vaccines work by training your body's immune system to recognize and fight off a specific virus or bacteria without you having to get sick first. It's like giving your body a "cheat sheet" to prepare for a future invasion. üõ°Ô∏è

Here is the process of immunization in simple terms:

Introducing a Blueprint: A vaccine introduces a safe, weakened, or inactive piece of a germ (called an antigen) into your body. This piece cannot cause the actual disease.

The Immune System Responds: Your immune system sees this harmless piece as an invader and creates special proteins called antibodies to fight it. Think of antibodies as the soldiers of your immune system, custom-built for one specific enemy.

Creating a Memory: Most importantly, your immune system also creates memory cells. These cells remember exactly how to defeat that specific germ.

Future Protection: If you are ever exposed to the real, active germ in the future, your memory cells recognize it immediately. They quickly order a massive production of the right antibodies to destroy the germ before it can make you sick.

This process gives you immunity, providing long-term protection against that disease.
### 4. Missing Word Prompting:
 Prompt 1: "The capital of France is ____."

The capital of France is **Paris**. 

Prompt 2: "In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce ____."

In photosynthesis, plants absorb sunlight to produce **glucose** (their food/sugar). 


# Result: 
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully.
